# isc-proposal-geometa-iso19115-3

The present project enhances the [_geometa_](https://cran.r-project.org/package=geometa) package for handling the new ISO 19115-3 geographic information standard as part of its object-oriented data model developed with [R6](https://cran.r-project.org/package=R6). 

The user community, especially data managers working in research national institutes and international organizations, will take advantage of the features to start adopting the new standard for managing their geographic metadata, progressively promoted in Geographic information management web plateforms, especially those from the [OpenSource Geospatial Foundation](https://www.osgeo.org/) (OSGeo) such as [GeoNetwork](https://www.osgeo.org/projects/geonetwork/), [PyCSW](https://www.osgeo.org/projects/pycsw/) or [GeoNode](https://www.osgeo.org/projects/geonode/).
