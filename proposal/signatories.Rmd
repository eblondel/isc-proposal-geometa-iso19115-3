# Signatories
<!-- 
This section provides the ISC with a view of the support received from the community for a proposal. Acceptance isn't predicated on popularity but community acceptance is important.  Willingness to accept outside input is also a good marker for project delivery. 

An optional section would be for R-Core signatories where changes to R are proposed.

> _ISO 19115-3 is a major step forward in geographic resources description by bridging various ISO models into a common entity. Data model (aka feature catalogue) can now be described directly in the metadata. Usage and quality are now 2 specific sections. ISO 19157 is used for quality reports and measures. ISO19115-2 for imagery is now part of the encoding. GeoNetwork is now supporting that standard and some members of the community are adopting it for their daily work eg. Service Public de Wallonie - Metawal, Ifremer - Checkpoints projects, ANZLIC._
